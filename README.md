**Real / Fake job postings**

For this project I used the *real/fake job posting* dataset found on kaggle.com. The aim of this project is to train a machine learning model that predicts if a job posting is real or fake, so it is a classification problem. The dataset consists of around 18.000 job descriptions, where about 800 of them are fake. This is my first attemp working on a NLP problem.
